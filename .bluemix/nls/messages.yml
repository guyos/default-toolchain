template.name: "PDS Assist Toolchain"
template.description: "With this cloud-native toolchain, you can deploy your own PDS Assist application that consists of three microservices: a PDS database API, an Orders database API, and the PDS Assist application that orchestrates calls to all other services. The toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery, source control, issue tracking, and online editing.\n\nThe PDS Assist application uses the Natural Language Understanding service and business rules deployed as Cloud Functions. As part of deploying this application, a no-cost NLU service instance is created. A cloud function action is created in the US-South region. For more information and terms, see the [Bluemix catalog - NLU](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/natural-language-understanding/) and [Bluemix catalog - Functions](https://console.bluemix.net/openwhisk/).\n\nThis toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If an instance of that service isn't already in the selected organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added with the free [Lite](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/) plan selected.\n\nTo get started, click **Create**."
template.gettingStarted: "**Your toolchain is ready!**\n**Quick start:** Commit a change to a Git repo to trigger a new build and deployment of one of the microservices. See results in the Deployment Risk dashboard in DevOps Insights.\nFor step-by-step instructions, see the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/devops/method/tutorials/tutorial_toolchain_microservices?task=3) for this toolchain."
